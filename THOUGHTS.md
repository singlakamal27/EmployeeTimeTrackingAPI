### Possible Extensions
- All the Endpoints can have much more possible scenarios

- Employees should have more fields, more endpoints example to search employee by name etc
- TimeTracking can be approached by more complex ways like Second Entry for the same employee for the same day 
    may complete EndTime for the existing entry.
- Locations and Categories can be extended.

### Further Improvements for Production

- Adding Authentication and Authorization
- Added more test cases to cover all possible scenarios
- Extending Models and Services
- Better log management

## CI / CD

- A proper CI/CD pipelines should be implemented for end to end development and deployment 
- This repo is created in Devops using Git and CI/CD pipelines build and deploy should be handy and facilitates
    automatic build creation and deployment.
- My next step would definitely be implementing pipelines so the new features and fixes are continuously deployed and 
    always ready for the QA
